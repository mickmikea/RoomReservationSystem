A requirements question I have, along with some thoughts:

Would you like us to do a room reservation system for Concord University that is streamlined, appealing, and fully functional, OR try and create a flexible system that can adapt to any university that will likely lack in functionality (not being pessimistic, hear me out)? One option is to webscrape for information and the other is to get information relying on user input. Some universities have over 15,000 courses scheduled (University of Michigan), having someone input all of this information would be extremely laborious. On the other hand, there are some serious stipulations that diverge when scoping out the feasibility of webscraping for course info. It looks like some universities hide their course information database from front-end users in order to only show courses currently available. Every university provides course descriptions but the location of each class and the time is not provided. Universities like Virginia Tech and WVU, you have to select classes by department or subject area. Then, a list is populated with courses in that filter. Since only the courses available are shown, this presents a problem in the knowledge base of when class times are. If a university uses this system of storing course information, we cannot use it for a room reservation system because the classes that are full will not show up. However, there are a few universities that provide CSV files of all of the locations and course times. This system seems like it can't be flexible because of how differently each university goes about storing their information. On top of that, each university has different building codes. It would take a copious amount of effort to tailor and prep the information for each university. If it is a requirement that we have to provide support for multiple universities, we should consider contacting the IT and registrars' offices at each college we are setting up the system for to see if they can send us a CSV file, or some other formatted list of courses, times, and locations.
